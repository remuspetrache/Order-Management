# Order-Management
Consider an application OrderManagement for processing client orders for a warehouse. Relational databases are used to store the products, the clients and the orders. Furthermore, the application should be structured in packages using a layered architecture presented in the support presentation (ASSIGNMENT_3_SUPPORT_PRESENTATION.pdf) and should use (minimally) the following classes:

•	Model classes - represent the data models of the application

•	Business Logic classes - contain the application logic

• Presentation classes – GUI related classes

•	Data access classes - classes that contain the access to the database
